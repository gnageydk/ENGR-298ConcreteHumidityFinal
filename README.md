# ENGR-298ConcreteHumidityFinal

Recreating graphical analysis done in MatLab by using Python. Data samples taken from research done by Dr. Castaneda on relative humidity in concrete.
Using equations given in research documents, graphs were generated in order to display readings from sensors taken over the course of a year.

We are concerned with graphing these two values (Relative Humidity and Saturation) over time to observe the wetting and drying cycles of concrete over a year
in order to look into what might cause the deterioration of concrete.

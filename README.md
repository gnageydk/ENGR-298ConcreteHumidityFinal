Recreating graphical analysis done in MatLab by using Python. Data samples taken from research done by Dr. Castaneda on relative humidity in concrete.
Using equations given in research documents, graphs were generated in order to display readings from sensors taken over the course of a year.

In the Chapter 2 - Field Study pdf, page 10 shows equation 2-14 which was used to calculate relative humidity of a specific concrete sample over the course
of 2014 in time intervals of ten minutes.

In the Chapter 3 - RH to Saturation pdf, page 21 shows equation 3-11 which was used to solve for the degree of saturation, which can be seen graphically
in figure 3-15.

We are concerned with graphing these two values (Relative Humidity and Saturation) over time to observe the wetting and drying cycles of concrete over a year
in order to look into what might cause the deterioration of concrete.
